Changes:
- Abilities, Items: Target Selection: Raycast: The 'Use Target Raycast' setting has been replaced by a selection. Either use 'None' (no target raycast), 'Default' (the default target raycast settings defined in 'Battles > Target Settings') or 'Custom' (a custom raycast setup). Previous settings will be updated to 'Custom' when raycast targeting was used.
- Combatants: Object Variables: The 'Object Variable Settings' are now an override setting for the default setup in the combatant general settings. Previous setup will be updated automatically to using custom settings if 'Use Object Variables' was enabled.
- Move AIs: Following the group leader now defaults to moving to a position based on the follow range instead of the leader's position. To return to the previous behaviour, enable 'Use Leader Position' in the 'Group Settings' of the move AI.
- Battle Components: The 'Chance' setting of combatants is now also used for 'All Groups/Combatants' or when not using 'Use Chance Selection'. A combatant/group will not be used if the chance check fails. Previously the 'Chance' setting was exclusively for the 'Use Chance Selection' mode.
- Battle Grids: Improvements for grid painting in 2D mode, now showing the brush cursor when no collider was hit (e.g. due to walkable tilemap not having colliders).
- Menu Screens: Group: The 'Group Content Layout' settings have been renamed to 'Content Layout (Non-Combatant)' to better state their purpose. They're only used for the empty and back buttons, as the combatant buttons are handled by the 'Combatant Choice Layout' settings of the menu part.

Fixes:
- Equipment: Random Status Value Bonuses: Fixed an issue where random status value bonuses where lost when equipping an equipment or loading a save game.

- Camera Controls: Control Target transition: Fixed issues with target transitions not working correctly.
- Battle Grids: Generation: Fixed an issue with separate block/empty cell raycasts hitting more than they should in 2D environments.
- Battle Menus: Sub-Menus: Fixed a potential issue in 'Multi Mode' keeping one of the sub-menu boxes open when closing the battle menu.
- HUD Shortcut Slot List Component: Fixed an issue where 'Defined' list type didn't show any slots.
